# Go PHP parser

A port of [php7parser](https://github.com/bmewburn/php7parser) by [bmewburn](bmewburn) to Go

## Reasons
- My first project in Go and this project is an excuse to learn go
- Performance is what I am looking for and [Intelephense](https://github.com/bmewburn/intelephense) which uses php7parser is very fast
- Will be the base for my PHP language server in the future
- Since Go is compile language so hopefully I can squeeze a little bit more performance out of the language itself
